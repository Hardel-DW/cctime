Global Rules :

- No redundancy.
- no function/variable with a single use (IMPORTANT) Expect some exception like
  generic Getter/Setter
- Avoid it over engineering.
- Be clean and methodical, make reusable things, and make simple.
- Structure correctly.
- No useless function/variable.
- No support of Legacy/Deprecated
- Avoid Comment.
- Each class or files should have a single responsibility. Dont put a function
  in inappropriate place.
- Avoid hacky or dirty code.
- If you need a heavy refactoring, ask me for permission with the plan.
- It's better to tell me what you have in mind before doing it.
- Most importantly, avoid private functions for single use, especially if they
  are less than 2–3 lines.
- Avoid useless files or class containing only a single function, or a funciton
  used by one file.
- Don't make useless "UTIL" class, when you doing something.
